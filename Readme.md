In this notebook we use CNN to classify images of foods classified into three categories: Bread, Soup, and Vegetable-Fruits. Our model categorizes
images and labels them accordingly.

We developed three models with different filters, kernel size, activation function, and dropout rate to see which one yielded better accuracy and reduced
the overfitting of data. The data was standardized and normalized and we considered relu and softmax as activation functions.
